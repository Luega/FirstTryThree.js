## Introduction

The project involves the creation of an immersive and engaging user experience based on an animated 3D background.
The fully responsive design also includes the addition of centered text and a button that initiates a custom animation.

## Technologies

Three.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create and display 3D computer graphics in a web browser. It provides a simple way to create 3D objects, scenes, and animations, which can be rendered in a canvas element in a web page.

GreenSock is a JavaScript animation library that makes it easy to create complex animations with just a few lines of code. It provides a powerful set of tools for creating animations that can be applied to Three.js objects.

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to design responsive websites. It provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be used to style HTML elements without writing custom CSS.

Vite is a build tool that provides fast and efficient development workflows. It uses modern web technologies like ES modules and native JavaScript features to provide a fast and streamlined development experience.
